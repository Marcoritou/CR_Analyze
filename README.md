# Usage
Most of the scripts have internal comments that describe the use and method to load the counterrotating particles of a given subhalo.
Docstrings are also provided for the methods that describe the general use of them.
The scripts are designed with the IlustrisTNG data in mind, as such it uses its library which can be found in the link provided at the bottom.
However it is possible to adapt the scripts to be used in other data.
